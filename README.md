Movies App

Built a responsive Movie Discovery web application using React, Tailwind CSS, and Appwrite. The app allows users to search for movies with an optimized experience, suggesting trending results based on community search frequency.

Key features include:

    Live search with useDebounce to minimize API calls and improve performance

    Real-time movie fetching using useEffect and useState

    Trending suggestions powered by Appwrite, based on aggregated user search data

    Clean, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS

    Modular component structure for scalability and maintainability

The project showcases modern React development practices, API integration, and basic backend-as-a-service (BaaS) usage for enhanced user experience and data-driven features.
